<h2>Concerning the Contents</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>OME time ago I was spending a driven but happy forenoon among those
shops where guns, and fishing tackle, and tents, and all the various
necessities of a Western holiday are found. My time was crowded, and
against the column of items on my list only a few checks had been made,
when I reached “Groceries.” Now, unless you have spent such forenoons
and holidays yourself, the visit among the guns and fishing tackle may
seem to raise questions of greater moment than any which could occur in
the grocery shop. But this is not so. A man soon learns what weapons he
prefers, and enters with his mind settled in advance; whereas, when it
comes to evaporated vegetables, condensed soups, and pellets that can
expand into a meal, you pause over each novelty, and with divided
purpose wretchedly choose and unchoose until you are scarce more manlike
than a woman. At least, such is my case; and having no minutes to
squander this forenoon, I had pencilled my supplies to avoid discussion
and temptation. Even while I was directing how I wished the parcels
tied, mentioning that they were to be much jolted on the backs of
horses, the shopman looked suddenly alert, and said this sounded like a
camping trip. Yes, I told him in my elation, I was bound for the head
waters of Wind River in Wyoming. Instantly the merchant fell from him;
every trace of groceries left his expression; his eye beamed with
eagerness, and he asked in the voice of one who gives the countersign,
“Have you ever been to Arizona?” and hearing that I had, “I served there
under Crook!” he exclaimed. Then names of the North and the South came
to his lips&mdash;San Carlos, San Simon, the Gila, the Chiricahuas, the Tonto
Basin, the forks of the Owyhee, Boise, Bidwell, Harney&mdash;he spoke of many
familiar to me; and next we were hard at it, this old soldier and
myself, exchanging enthusiasms, gossiping in comradeship among the dried
prunes. Thus I wasted minutes that I could not spare, yet lost nothing
by it; my parcels were put up right. And when this errand was finished,
he watched me depart from the shop door, and sighed, “I should like to
see it all again!”</p>

<p>Since that day I have gone back to him, not always to buy groceries, but
just to pass the word, and thus in the midst of city streets to conjure
up Arizona, or Idaho, or Wyoming. My journeys through those regions have
come after his time. I know none of his dangers and not many of his
hardships. But I too have seen Summer and Winter in the Rocky Mountains,
and the sun rise; and have slept and marched on trails where he went
once. Between us is established a freemasonry: both of us have been <i>out
there</i>; both of us understand. It matters not that one was an enlisted
man campaigning against Indians, while the other is nothing but a
voluntary pilgrim to the wilderness. Upon both alike has the wilderness
set its spell. Yes; we certainly understand.</p>

<p>And what is this spell? Scarcely danger, for I have met no dangers
worthy of the name. Scarcely freedom, since the enlisted man can do by
no means what he pleases. Scarcely the immortal lift and purity of that
great air, which I feel, indeed, but to which I can not remember hearing
any trooper allude. Neither will the splendor of Nature explain it; the
inspiring vastness, the transfigurations of the sunset, the swimming
oceans of color, rich, subtle, endless, the more inexhaustible as the
more observed. Only the pilgrims value these things. The chance for
riches it certainly is not, nor the chance for crime. Crime and Fortune
are there as everywhere; but the lost pocket-book is returned when it
would not be in a city, and you meet with few that are troubling about
dollars. Bloody and sudden as death often is there, it is not the
planned murder so much as the quick blow of personal vengeance, the
primitive man dealing with his fellow as in justice he expects his
fellow will deal with him. Finally, it is not adventure alone. Though
roving spirits have come to their own upon the plains, and with Indians
and cattle-driving have let loose the fervid energy no town gave room
for, dreamers strayed there too, many dreamers, and found happiness. In
all of this I am speaking of the wilderness as it was once, and almost
is no more. But you will find the dreamers still, now and then, riding
alone from horizon to horizon, paddling upon sequestered rivers,
hermiting in quiet cabins, all of them escaped from social codes,
reaping the reward and paying the penalty in that archaic silence. For
indeed the silence of that world seems to have come unbroken from behind
Genesis, to have been earlier than the beginning, to make one with the
planets, to have known mysteries, that dwindle Rome to a show. The
little sounds of earth do not break it. In it the painted Indian walks
naked, the twin of its mystery. In it you can wake or sleep, and no man
hinders. Whatever law there is, rises from the ground or falls from the
stars. For the very living, life seems to mingle with the origin before
the dust has returned to dust. That is the spell for trooper or for
pilgrim. From empire to empire, our wise brains have devised conventions
that we may live together, but our unwise hearts crave the something
that wisdom has renounced for us. So most of those you will meet in the
wilderness, be they doers or dreamers, have followed the heart’s desire
and escaped back to Nature.</p>

<p>Ah, there is a lotus also in the West! It has drugged many that have
never returned. But if you wisely tear yourself from it and re-enter the
fold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> civilization, and in respectable content sell groceries, for
instance, your heart will remind you of <i>out there</i>, now and then, a
word like Owyhee or Wind River will give you a homesickness for the
nameless magic of the plains.</p>

<p>Those happy ones who have known it meet always in that freemasonry which
set the soldier and me talking like old acquaintances. And therefore I
am going to show him these drawings; for every one will speak to him of
<i>out there</i>. He will rejoice in their truth&mdash;indeed truth is a pale
word&mdash;it is the vibrating thing itself which seems to rise out of these
pages. Even to me they flash and throb with life I have lived, and how
much more to a man whose years preceded mine and who had dangers where I
had none!</p>

<p>I have stood before many paintings of the West. Paintings of mountains,
paintings of buffalo, paintings of Indians&mdash;the whole mystic and heroic
pageant of our American soil; the only greatly romantic thing our
generation has known, the last greatly romantic thing our Continent
holds; indeed the poetic episode most deeply native that we possess.
Long before my eyes looked upon its beautiful domain, I studied the
paintings; but when Remington came with only a pencil, I forgot the
rest! And now I have seen for myself, and know how he has caught alive
not only the roped calf, or the troop cook sucking his comfortable
corn-cob, the day-by-day facts of the wilderness, but the eternal note
also, the pity and the awe of that epic life. He has made them visible
by his art, and set them down as a national treasure. Look at the Pony
War Dance. That wild fury of religion, that splendor of savagery clashes
down to us from the Stone Age. If you will open the Old Testament where
Joshua delayed the course of the sun, or they blew down a city wall with
a trumpet, you will come upon the same spirit. Look at the Medicine-men
and the lightning. Again man’s untamed original soul communes with a God
of vengeance and terror. Is it not like Elijah and the fire-stroke from
heaven upon the altar? Then turn to the Sheep-herder’s breakfast. Unless
you have known that solitude, no words of mine can tell you how
Remington has been a poet here. With some lines and smears on paper he
has expressed that lotus mystery of the wilderness. He has taken a
ragged vagrant with a frying-pan and connected him with the eternal. The
dog, the pack-saddle, the ass, the dim sheep in the plain, those tender
outlines of bluffs and ridges&mdash;it is Homer or the Old Testament again;
time and the present world have no part here!</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not value all this as I do. Perhaps the seamy side shuts
you from the rest, and you shrink from the brutality of man and the
suffering of beast. I have heard people speak thus sometimes, and give
thanks for their books, and their bathrooms, for the opera, and for
Europe where they can travel in a landscape seasoned by history. Well,
Europe is richer, much richer, than any desert, and it is toward its use
and comprehension, on the whole, that our struggling faces are set. Our
fond, quack-ridden Republic looks, after all, toward the old world for
its teaching. But we have a landscape seasoned by mystery, where chiefs
and heroes move, fit subjects for the poet. If you do not see this,
perhaps you are too near. Let me ask you to think of the bloody
slaughters in Homer, and of all the great art you know from him to the
present day; has not the terrible its share of notice? Doubtless you
would have stopped Homer’s reciting to you how bodies were hacked to
pieces beneath the walls of Troy, and how swinish were sometimes the
companions of Ulysses. But now you read it all with pleasure. Do you
believe Art would have amounted to much if it had excluded pain and
ugliness and narrowed its gaze upon the beautiful alone?</p>

<p>At any rate I am glad that we have Remington, one of the kind that makes
us aware of things we could not have seen for ourselves. We have been
scarce enough in native material for Art to let go what the soil
provides us. We have often failed to value what the intelligent
foreigner seizes upon at once. And I think as the Frontier recedes into
tradition, fewer of us will shrink from its details. If Remington did
nothing further, already has he achieved: he has made a page of American
history his own.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
